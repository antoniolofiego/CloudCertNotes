# Cloud Certifications Notes

A repository of the notes I take while preparing for Cloud/Tech Certifications.

Feel free to contribute with your own notes if you find something that could be useful for everyone!

**Please note:** These notes are updated in the way I study for the various exams. They probably are not a standalone study tool, as I do not write down repeating material across different notesets. For example, most of the services are covered in the Solutions Architect - Associate exam, so you will not find detailed explanations in the Certified Developer - Associate notes, as it assumes familiarity with the previous material.
